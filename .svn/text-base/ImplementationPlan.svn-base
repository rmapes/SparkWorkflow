Workflow System Test/Implementation Plan 


Support for current workflow
	x Basic workflow : test command to generate hello world file
	x Basic workflow with assignment: 
		test assignment to variable
		test command with variable in parameters - embedded
		test command with variable in parameters - straight
	x Sequenced jobs – single threaded
	x Sequenced jobs – parameter passing
(Pre refactor - WorkflowFramework.1.zip)
(Post refactor - WorkflowFramework.2.zip)
	Sequenced jobs – parallel
	x	By parameter
	x	By config
	Sequenced jobs – assignments within job sequence 
	x   RunCommand: output capture to return variable
	Basic expressions

	Base context assignments
	Properties loading
	
	JMX trigger
x		- basic implementation
		- limited to jobs specified in config section
		- better calling mechanism

	Functions

Persistence / Resilience
	x Sequenced jobs - singled threaded
	x Sequenced jobs - assignment from method call
(WorkflowFramework.3.zip)

    x assert that all contexts completed by end of test run
    	- for all test runs
    Add context safety to Proxy call to job queue
    x Remove context at end of Restart trigger.
    
    Replace in memory with db

Reporting and Alerting
	Syntax error  reporting



Advanced

	Complex expressions
	Self defined triggers
	Task extensions
	
	
TODO:
    x Produce basic installation with hello world examples for windows
    Produce basic installation with hello world examples for linux
    Provide documentation
    Refactor
    Clean up parser and compiler to ensure code matches spec
    Launch as open source project
    Get others involved
    Complete basic functionality
    	Base config assignments (including load from properties file)
    	Syntax error reporting
    	Replace in memory persistence with db persistence
    Rework jmx functionality
Release 1.0

	Further work:
		flow control
		complex expressions
		improved jmx control and monitoring
		GUI console
